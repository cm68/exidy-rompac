this is a 3d printable exidy rom-pac case

install openscad, run make, and print the generated STL files to your
heart's content.

I printed mine on a flashforge guider 2S on PLA

i used 220 degrees filament, 60 degree platform with brim, no raft,
25% fill.

yeah, it's GPL3.  ship it and derived works with buildable source code; 
if you learned something from this, you must pay that learning forward.
