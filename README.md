this is a 3d printable exidy rom-pac case, tested with the original rom-pac
and the modern clone at https://github.com/abzman/Exidy-Sorcerer-Stuff

I uploaded it to thingyverse.

install openscad, run make, and print the generated STL files to your
heart's content.

the rompac.stl file is not really useful as anything other than a visual
fit check or thumbnail.

I printed mine on a flashforge guider 2S with PLA, but be fine with anything

PLA at 215 degrees filament, 70 degree platform 
with raft, 25% fill. the pin is a bit weak

PETG at 240, platform 70 with shell thickness = 4mm.  
this has the pin strong enough.

the shells are held together with the press-fit pin, this might want a little
sanding, depending on your printer.  if it is loose, tape works.
i might put locking tabs on the inside surfaces of the front bevel,
if you do this before me, send it to me at curt@zen-room.org.

yeah, it's GPL3.  ship it and derived works with buildable source code; 
if you learned something from this, you must pay that learning forward.
