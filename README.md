this is a 3d printable exidy rom-pac case

I uploaded it to thingyverse.

install openscad, run make, and print the generated STL files to your
heart's content.

the rompac.stl file is not really useful as anything other than a visual
fit check or thumbnail.

I printed mine on a flashforge guider 2S with nylon, but be fine with anything

nylon at 260 degrees filament, 77 degree platform 
with brim, no raft, 25% fill.

yeah, it's GPL3.  ship it and derived works with buildable source code; 
if you learned something from this, you must pay that learning forward.
